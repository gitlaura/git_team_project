Welcome to the Git Class Project

This small ruby project was created so that a class of people can practice cloning, branching, creating pull requests, and merging in git. 

Follow along with these steps:

1. Get a number assigned to you so you know which class to edit. 
2. $git clone <this repo>
3. $git branch <firstname-description> (ex: Laura-EditClassOne)
4. $git checkout <firstname-description>
5. Edit the class you've been assigned
6. $git add . 
7. $git commit -m"message_here"
8. $git push origin <firstname-description>
9. Create pull request to gitlaura
10. Git owner merges each branch
11. $git checkout master
11. $git pull
12. $git branch -d <old_branch_name>

Then start over at step 3!
