Welcome to the Git Class Project!!

This small ruby project was created so that a class of people can practice cloning, branching, creating pull requests, merging, and rebasing in git. 

Follow along with these steps for Class #2:

1. Get a number assigned to you so you know which class to edit. 
2. $git clone (this repo)
3. $git branch (firstname-description) (ex: Laura-EditClassOne)
4. $git checkout (firstname-description)
5. Edit the class you've been assigned
6. $git add . 
7. $git commit -m"message"
8. $git push origin <firstname-description>
9. Create pull request to gitlaura
10. Git owner merges each branch
11. $git checkout master
12. $git pull
13. $git branch -d (old_branch_name)
Then start over at step 3! 

Follow along with these steps for Class #3:

1. git clone (this repo)
2. cd (this repo)
3. $git checkout -b (new_branch_name)
4. vim (file_assigned _to_you) (edit file)
5. $git add / $git commit
6. $git pull - - rebase origin master
7. vim (file_assigned _to_you) (clean up file)
8. $git add
9. $git rebase - - continue
10. $git push origin <new_branch>
