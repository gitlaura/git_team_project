Welcome to the Git Class Project!

This small ruby project was created so that a class of people can practice cloning, branching, creating pull requests, and merging in git. 

How to start:

1. Get a number assigned to you so you know which class to edit. 
2. $git clone 
3. $git branch firstname-description (ex: Laura-EditClassOne)
4. $git checkout firstname-description
5. Edit the class you've been assigned
6. $git add . 
7. $git commit -m"message_here"
8. $git push origin branch_name
9. create pull request to gitlaura
10. watch it get merged
11. $git checkout master
11. $git fetch
12. $git merge
13. $git branch -d old_branch_name

The start over!
